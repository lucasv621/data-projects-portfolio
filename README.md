## Brief Project Summaries:

### Conjoint Analysis Applied to Apartment Rental:
The goal of this project was to apply Conjoint Analysis, a market research technique that assesses preferences by analyzing how people make choices among products or services with varying features, to apartment rental. The analysis utilized the Python package Statsmodels for conducting linear regressions across the responses of all survey participants. Key findings included:
- Determining the importance of each attribute for each respondent
- Estimating the willingness to pay for upgrades in specific attributes
- Segmentation of respondents using unsupervised learning techniques
- Simulation of market shares based on preferences
