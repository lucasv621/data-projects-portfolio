# Lucas Veteikis Data Projects Portfolio

This repository contains different data-related projects I've worked on, including assignments from university (Master in Management + Analytics, UTDT) and personal ones.

## Brief Project Summaries

### Conjoint Analysis Applied to Apartment Rental
The goal of this project was to apply Conjoint Analysis, a market research technique that assesses preferences by analyzing how people make choices among products or services with varying features, to apartment rental. The analysis utilized the Python package Statsmodels for conducting linear regressions across the responses of all survey participants. Key findings included:
- Determining the importance of each attribute for each respondent
- Estimating the willingness to pay for upgrades in specific attributes
- Segmentation of respondents using unsupervised learning techniques
- Simulation of market shares based on preferences

### Contact Prediction Challenge
This project was part of a Kaggle Competition where our team ranked in the top 30%. The competition aimed to predict whether a post on an accommodation marketplace would receive more than 3 contacts within the initial 15 days. We dealt with a dataset containing millions of observations and numerous features. The prediction process involved:

- Analyzing the data to extract valuable insights and eliminate irrelevant information
- Crafting new features to improve our predictive abilities
- Utilizing sparse matrices
- Implementing various models like Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and ultimately XgBoost to achieve optimal performance in the competition.
